""After the Reddit-driven short squeeze in January, WallStreetBets users again turned their attention toward this cannabis stock. One Reddit user wrote in a post last week that Tilray ""is a movement,"" adding that the company has ""fantastic stats"" and is ""a worthy opponent to AMC"" as a meme stock. Per Quiver Quantitative, the cannabis stock was mentioned 922 times on WallStreetBets over the past five days. Shares of TLRY are up just 7.8% so far this month, suggesting that the stock rally is yet to start.

Investors should note that Tilray has emerged as the world's largest cannabis company following its blockbuster merger with Aphria in May. The Canadian cannabis producer has an estimated revenue growth rate of 49.9% and earnings per share growth rate of 84.3% for this fiscal year (ending May 2022). The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 and a Growth Score of A"".

More often than not they're coming from a single place that is increasingly growing comfortable with posting the links to single submissions with the intent of getting their users to come hassle us and try to convince us their stock is the way.

Do me a favor and report that when you see it. It's against the site rules and fucking annoying because random submissions turn into hostile territory and are decidedly *not* wallstreetbets anymore.",1,2021-06-18 14:48:59

More often than not they're coming from a single place that is increasingly growing comfortable with posting the links to single submissions with the intent of getting their users to come hassle us and try to convince us their stock is the way.

Do me a favor and report that when you see it. It's against the site rules and fucking annoying because random submissions turn into hostile territory and are decidedly *not* wallstreetbets anymore.",1,2021-06-18 14:48:59
