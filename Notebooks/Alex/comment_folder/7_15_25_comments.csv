It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how wealthy you are it will bankrupt you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or no other retard is gonna hit as hard as the market. But it ain't about the trades ya make. It's about how hard you can get margin called and keep losing more tendies. Its about how much you can lose and keep depositing more. That's how winning is done!

Look at the 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 year [charts on $SPY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY?p=SPY&.tsrc=fin-srch) and there will be some speed bumps along the way, but it will always go up.
