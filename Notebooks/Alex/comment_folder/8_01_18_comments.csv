I knew the AMD thesis for months and originally bought tens of thousands in shares and options back when it was at around 80, then 77. I even posted about it on my snapchat when it was 77 predicting that it would go over 100 ""in 6 to 9 months tops"". There was an obvious opportunity to make 25+% gains easily on AMD with very low risk and nobody was seeing it here. I'm glad you all realize now that this stock is truly undervalued (especially below $80... what a steal) and destroying the competition.

""So i started a free trial with Ortex to gain access to their short interest report. As described in thier words ""ORTEX short interest data is sourced from the worlds largest combined pool of agent lenders, prime brokers, and broker-dealers who submit their inventory"", so this may be our best short at getting an aggregate market-level view of the overall short interest on MVST.  
Look at the numbers highlighted in red. Total shares on loan is 9.32M, utilization of these 9.32M shares is 99.97%, and cost to borrow is 22.87%. This is many times more than what we all have been thinking. The fact that utilization of their borrowed shares is 99.97% means, there is literally only 2796 shares availble to short. If we keep up the momentum we may be in for a larger squeeze than initially thought. Please share this info!!""",66,2021-08-09 16:24:53

Still substantially up, but if you're one of the guys who bought it up top I wouldn't worry. As long as they're shares and not short term call options, you'll be fine. This company is set to grow substantially in the future. Proven battery tech, vertically integrated, and a constant stream of massive deals coming in. I know this sub is known for acting rash and making quick decisions, but this stock is a serious play that requires a bit of patience imo. Just my 2 cents.",48,2021-08-11 10:02:56

109,p3lyj6,Jamel-Smoov,"Sofi is the most undervalued lending stock right now. But we did our DD and see some key factors with LC and UPST that made the difference in their stock prices going up while SOFI went down even with enormous growth and potential.

Ownership structures:
LC is almost 88% owned by insiders and institutions. 
UPST is about 89% owned by insiders and institutions 
SOFI is only about 30% owned by insiders and institutions with the majority of shares owned by the public

Notice that both LC and UPST received extra positive coverage after earnings, and just continued to go up in price. They also received a mountain of positive media coverage. 

SOFI on the other hand which arguably has more potential and experienced enormous growth went down in price due to inaccurate analyst coverage for eps which was off only because of SOFI making a one time investment in their own expansion. If analysts were actually doing their jobs the 2 who were off with their estimates wouldve included such a major capital expenditure in their predictions 

Take note that for LC and UPST the insiders are the ones profiting from share price going up and when so many big names are behind a company they tend to receive more favorable coverage and softer estimates from analysts so they appear to be doing better than they are. These insiders and institutions will eventually sell their shares to retail investors to take profits and then price will go down. They may also used the inflated prices that are also manipulated up to do a share offering to generate more cash. 

If you want to invest in a company to help regular investors like all of us rather than the institutions then the choice is Sofi, not almost fully insider and institution owned stocks like LC or UPST. Those companies will also likely manipulate price to close options worthless or near worthless as well. 

Interest Rates
The Fed has been avoiding their tapering of FOMC activity to keep rates near 0 but everyone knows that they cannot avoid this much longer with inflation getting out of control and positive job reports coming in steady now. This is why lending companies and banks have been going up lately and that is why LC and UPST received an extra boost. SOFI is also going to benefit tremendously from the increased rates along with their already increased growth and expansion which theyve accomplished with rates near 0. The next year will be one of the biggest for the financial sector in a while because rates have been near 0 for so long. SOFI is the future, they are one of the leading fintech companies and of the 3 discussed here they are the only one that the public has a chance at actually buying a share of and truly profiting off of. For LC and UPST only the institutions and insiders are profiting mostly, and thats the opposite of what WSB stands for and those stocks are a prime example of insider manipulation and media/pundit/analyst favor trading.",33,2021-08-13 20:23:57

109,p3lyj6,Jamel-Smoov,"Sofi is the most undervalued lending stock right now. But we did our DD and see some key factors with LC and UPST that made the difference in their stock prices going up while SOFI went down even with enormous growth and potential.

Ownership structures:
LC is almost 88% owned by insiders and institutions. 
UPST is about 89% owned by insiders and institutions 
SOFI is only about 30% owned by insiders and institutions with the majority of shares owned by the public

Notice that both LC and UPST received extra positive coverage after earnings, and just continued to go up in price. They also received a mountain of positive media coverage. 

SOFI on the other hand which arguably has more potential and experienced enormous growth went down in price due to inaccurate analyst coverage for eps which was off only because of SOFI making a one time investment in their own expansion. If analysts were actually doing their jobs the 2 who were off with their estimates wouldve included such a major capital expenditure in their predictions 

Take note that for LC and UPST the insiders are the ones profiting from share price going up and when so many big names are behind a company they tend to receive more favorable coverage and softer estimates from analysts so they appear to be doing better than they are. These insiders and institutions will eventually sell their shares to retail investors to take profits and then price will go down. They may also used the inflated prices that are also manipulated up to do a share offering to generate more cash. 

If you want to invest in a company to help regular investors like all of us rather than the institutions then the choice is Sofi, not almost fully insider and institution owned stocks like LC or UPST. Those companies will also likely manipulate price to close options worthless or near worthless as well. 

Interest Rates
The Fed has been avoiding their tapering of FOMC activity to keep rates near 0 but everyone knows that they cannot avoid this much longer with inflation getting out of control and positive job reports coming in steady now. This is why lending companies and banks have been going up lately and that is why LC and UPST received an extra boost. SOFI is also going to benefit tremendously from the increased rates along with their already increased growth and expansion which theyve accomplished with rates near 0. The next year will be one of the biggest for the financial sector in a while because rates have been near 0 for so long. SOFI is the future, they are one of the leading fintech companies and of the 3 discussed here they are the only one that the public has a chance at actually buying a share of and truly profiting off of. For LC and UPST only the institutions and insiders are profiting mostly, and thats the opposite of what WSB stands for and those stocks are a prime example of insider manipulation and media/pundit/analyst favor trading.",32,2021-08-13 20:23:57

Ill say this: CLOV gama skweeze potential is insane this week, with truly massive call spreads, all the way up to $43. Unfortunately, even with a ~150 million volume day last week following an awesome earnings, the shorts were still able to push the price below 8.5 EOW using over 50% dark pool volume and collect our options premiums.

Any surge in volume pushing the price over $9.5-10 could spark the options chain, but the shorts are so desperate, and unfortunately I just dont know where that volume comes from It would be nice if any DD could be shared in this sub, but guess Im dreaming.",65,2021-08-16 07:54:51

But since they seemed to not have given up, that seems unlikely.  Given price action and fairly low volume they're also not really buying a ton of shares either.

Thus my conclusion is this, either:

1. Shitload of CC writing or put spreads and once this week is done they peace and be happy to be relieved of shill duty.

2.  They're bagholding on an unprecedented scale but also will not fucking sell.  This an act of civil disobedience, Occupy WallStreetBets.  We are their hostages.",14,2021-08-17 19:00:59
