Ill say this: CLOV gama skweeze potential is insane this week, with truly massive call spreads, all the way up to $43. Unfortunately, even with a ~150 million volume day last week following an awesome earnings, the shorts were still able to push the price below 8.5 EOW using over 50% dark pool volume and collect our options premiums.

Any surge in volume pushing the price over $9.5-10 could spark the options chain, but the shorts are so desperate, and unfortunately I just dont know where that volume comes from It would be nice if any DD could be shared in this sub, but guess Im dreaming.",65,8/16/2021 7:54

Thus my conclusion is this, either:

1. Shitload of CC writing or put spreads and once this week is done they peace and be happy to be relieved of shill duty.

2.  They're bagholding on an unprecedented scale but also will not fucking sell.  This an act of civil disobedience, Occupy WallStreetBets.  We are their hostages.",14,8/17/2021 19:00
