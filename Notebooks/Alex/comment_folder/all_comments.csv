One Reddit user wrote in a post last week that Tilray ""is a movement,"" adding that the company has ""fantastic stats"" and is ""a worthy opponent to AMC"" as a meme stock. Per Quiver Quantitative, the cannabis stock was mentioned 922 times on WallStreetBets over the past five days. Shares of TLRY are up just 7.8% so far this month, suggesting that the stock rally is yet to start.

Investors should note that Tilray has emerged as the world's largest cannabis company following its blockbuster merger with Aphria in May. The Canadian cannabis producer has an estimated revenue growth rate of 49.9% and earnings per share growth rate of 84.3% for this fiscal year (ending May 2022). The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 and a Growth Score of A"".

Wake up a bit before 6:30 to watch the stocks pre-market open.

Stock goes green : panic, realize that since you invested in it the stocks will eventually trade the opposite way and you'll lose money. Stare at your trading platform app 20303939 times a day

Stock goes red : panic, bite your nails hoping for it to climb. Check your trading platform 2020302235 times a day.

Get stressed, go to WSB for relief comedy and unintentional gambling intervention.

Find that one post where someone made 300k+ today.

Get upset that it wasn't you.

Lie to yourself, say you were gonna make that call. Beat yourself up about Stock inception.

Reason with yourself that the Stock will rise again and you don't want to miss it. 

Buy those calls.

455,McKoijion,"My hypotheses on China's tech crackdown:

1. Big tech has too much monopoly power. American politicians think Amazon, Facebook, Uber, etc. are too powerful. Chinese politicians think Alibaba, Didi, etc. are too powerful. But China's communist government has the will and ability to do something about it (compared to the US's capitalist or socialist-lite government). This is bearish for the stocks.

2. China is trying to spy on people. Their cybersecurity reviews are to install backdoor spy software, not protect people's privacy. It seems like they would just do it in secret without making a big public fuss though. I'm pretty sure they've been doing this for years so this doesn't seem new.

3. China wants a bigger cut of these companies' profit. The government is indirectly nationalizing these companies (taking more of the company's future cash flows without putting up capital). It's like how the US wants to raise taxes on US corporations. This is bearish short term if they are diluting foreign owners' ownership percentage, but bullish in the long term (since they'll start propping up the companies they now own).

4. Chinese tech entrepreneurs love capitalism and have gotten too politically active. Communist party leaders want to put them in their place. This is bullish since all those companies have to do is kiss the ring and they'll go back to making money. This makes sense since they're sabre rattling and taking a victory lap in light of their communist anniversary. 

Anyone know what's actually going on? Does anyone here live in China?",6,7/6/2021 6:41

1. Popeyes garbage can around 1:00-3:00 is PRIME since most people order large amounts of food at lunch and cant finish. You will get the most meat during this time. Also lots of fries there as well and biscuits.

2. Try the local shelter asking for food, cons are the line being long.

3. I typically enjoy spending $1 for a box of cookies. Calories are there to maintain a 2k calories/day.

4. Another popular spot is your local all you can eat sushi spot. A lot of the waste at the end of the day or mid-lunch shift is thrown into the garbage along with foods that people cant finish. Prime time is 2-3pm and 8-9pm. Popular items include leftover rolls, general tao chicken and stir fried noodles that people cant finish. You might lose some flavor due to wonton soup dumping into the flavor of the general tao but keep it real, its a dumpster.",62,7/8/2021 8:20

I dont know about you but I see a legit need for a pullback. Every time SPY has seen a greater than 40% growth from year to year it has some type of pullback around 15%

Look at the 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 year [charts on $SPY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY?p=SPY&.tsrc=fin-srch) and there will be some speed bumps along the way, but it will always go up.

386,Thomas_DuBois,">The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgagebacked securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.

>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.",10,7/28/2021 13:02

Powell says price increases won't be taken back, they're just going to stop legging up so hard but when the economy opens it will definitely persist.

This goes against the mandate of keeping inflation in line anyway because if inflation remains at 2% long-term after prices literally jump 10% in a ""transitory"" period, it means nothing since the value of the dollar is already lessened - damage is done.

HYG (High Yield or Junk Bond iShare ETF)

Within the bond market High have the highest correlation to stocks in price action and movement.  And while the moves in bonds are significantly less volatile these smaller moves move option prices like a mofo.  

The HYG is also a very liquid ETF & for that effect so are the options.  Cheaper and equally as effective way to play the SPY (again not gonna be a carbon copy but it gets the job done. Just need to play them much closer to the money or else its a losing bet). 

PS: this is also a perfect way to play a possible spike in yields.  Higher Rates kill bonds specially HY bonds (look at the chart and how it did in March of 2020 wow)",10,7/30/2021 7:53

Main requirement to join the S&P 500:

>last reported quarter must be profitable 

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters 

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy, when retail collapsed during COVID they booted Macy's out very quickly.

Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in the current climate.

JOB REPORT FOR THE MARKET; VERY MUCHO BAD FOR EXPENSIVE HIGH MULTIPLE STOCKS (anything trading over 20X Sales WATCH THE FK OUT). 

WHY ARE MANY MUCHO JOB BAD FOR MI STOCKS?  Well a very good job report means the economy is doing better AND IT WILL ADD PRESSURE TO THE FED & J-POW TO START TAPERING AND/OR START TO LOOK AT RAISING RATES. 

LOW RATES GOOD FOR MARKET; Price of $ is cheap and its ok to have a crazy ass valuation. 

HIGHER RATES = VENOM TO GROWTH STOCKS.  Price of $ rises.  But just go back to the SPY or QQQ performance in Feb or May similar to that but worst.

Stock exchanges stay open 24/7 and 365 days by Cloud AI. Christmas became a trading day when Cyborg Elon proclaimed Santa Claus as a fraud when he took TSLA private for the 3rd time now despite protest from the SEC.

BYND meat absorbed Tyson Foods as the future is now 90% soyboy and 10% entomophagan (what in the Roth IRA fuck is that?)

GOOGL has long fired all their employees as the *They took our jerbs* protests intensified when unemployment reached 90% by AI takeover.

The omega variant of the corona virus only affects AI and Mexicans from the Tijuana region. MRNA, who is a mega corporation now, promised a new booster shots for all you zoomer fucks being kept alive by machines. No one cares if you fought in world war 3.

AMZN still trades at $3,300 while competitors are trading at 2000% the value since 2021 because they refused to stock split.  Jeff Bezos, who now lives in New Seattle on Mars, was reached for comment. He simply said: fuck you poors, get the fuck off my property.
