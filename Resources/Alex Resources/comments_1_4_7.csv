Only down about 1.5-2k right now, but the loss might be more than that with AMZN gapping up again (sold another call yesterday at open, which turned out to be a really bad move).

Getting back on track to positive though.

Gonna try to make 1-2k scalping futures today. Yesterday was 1420 net on ES and 414 net on NQ (missed out on a lot for closing early in day), so 1834. Will see how things go. If it doesn't move much, might not be able to scalp that much. So far I scalped 219.50 net on NQ overnight from a small short. Not in a rush to get green right away.

Getting back on track to positive though.

Gonna try to make 1-2k scalping futures today. Yesterday was 1420 net on ES and 414 net on NQ (missed out on a lot for closing early in day), so 1834. Will see how things go. If it doesn't move much, might not be able to scalp that much. So far I scalped 219.50 net on NQ overnight from a small short. Not in a rush to get green right away.
