President Donald Trump announced a plan Friday to retrain the nations 3 million unemployed Americans to work as human ventilators. Were going to put Americans back to work by teaching them to lock lips with infected coronavirus patients and pump air into and out of their lungs, said Trump, who explained how the Department of Labor would be giving all out-of-work Americans an opportunity to take an accelerated training course to learn how to successfully provide ventilatory assistance to Covid-19 patients with their mouths. 

States asked for help, and weve listened. This is going to save hundreds, potentially thousands of lives, and put our nations great service workers back on their feet. There are thousands of very, very sick people waiting across the country with their mouths gaping open.

$SAVE is down 78% since February and has since then reported earnings, and done a secondary.

All bad news is priced in at the moment and the floor is set \~ $10.00

Float - 68mm / 12% Short

$SAVE is a ***domestic travel airline - no international exposure***, and their fleet also does not include the 737Max Skycoffins

Domestic travel/VFR is opening up, states are easing lockdowns, and companies are planning safe ways to operate. Airlines included.

$SAVE has not had its retard bounce yet, but its coming.

$CCL had a massive run after its bottom, ER, stock offering - and $SAVE is next.

TLDR: $SAVE $12.50C 5/15 if pp big

Suddenly I am awake, staring at the single ceiling fan above me. Its a hot, musky July morning, and my anniversary was the night before. I had come to bed many hours after my wife, the charts and crayons ate up my night and I hadnt laid a finger on her. 

I became aware of a sensation in my shorts and looked down at the flagpole under the covers.

Who is she? My wife asked with dejection in her eyes. I couldnt answer, so I rolled over in shame. I felt her get up from the bed, this time I faced her. Gathering her robe around her with tears in her eyes I hope she was worth it. She mutters as she whisks out the room.

I lay on the bed and arch my back as my body is rocked with an earth shattering stretch. I was back in the 737 with cotton candy clouds as I gripped the throbbing throttle and pulled.

2. Despite that 600% YoY increase in bookings article stretching the truth a bit, it strongly suggests people are eager to start traveling again after being cooped up for over a month. If we open in August, business will continue as usual. 
1. The Saudis bought an 8% stake in CCL. Y'all remember when we all used to think SNAP was going bankrupt back in October 2019--and we shorted the fuck out of SNAP? Saudis bought a 2.3% stake in the company. Look at where SNAP is today. No chance in Jahannam they'll let 8% of their cash burn to smoke.",7,2020-05-11 10:57:23

They missed earnings their last 2 quarters. Jan 2020 reported on 2/25/20. EPS .09 and consensus was 0.12. 

October 2019- reported 12/3/19. EPS 0.15. Consensus 0.21

5 days before each earnings report the stock topped out and eventually bled down. 

Since earnings is 5/28, more than likely the best move to dump sometime next week. This significant run up has me thinking to dump by the EOW though. I cant foresee them continuing to progress

They missed earnings their last 2 quarters. Jan 2020 reported on 2/25/20. EPS .09 and consensus was 0.12. 

October 2019- reported 12/3/19. EPS 0.15. Consensus 0.21

5 days before each earnings report the stock topped out and eventually bled down. 

Since earnings is 5/28, more than likely the best move to dump sometime next week. This significant run up has me thinking to dump by the EOW though. I cant foresee them continuing to progress
