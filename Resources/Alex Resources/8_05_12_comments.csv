JOB REPORT OVERALL ECONOMY: VERY MUCHO GOOD FOR THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY & STABILITY. 

JOB REPORT FOR THE MARKET; VERY MUCHO BAD FOR EXPENSIVE HIGH MULTIPLE STOCKS (anything trading over 20X Sales WATCH THE FK OUT). 

WHY ARE MANY MUCHO JOB BAD FOR MI STOCKS?  Well a very good job report means the economy is doing better AND IT WILL ADD PRESSURE TO THE FED & J-POW TO START TAPERING AND/OR START TO LOOK AT RAISING RATES. 

LOW RATES GOOD FOR MARKET; Price of $ is cheap and its ok to have a crazy ass valuation. 

HIGHER RATES = VENOM TO GROWTH STOCKS.  Price of $ rises.  But just go back to the SPY or QQQ performance in Feb or May similar to that but worst.

BYND meat absorbed Tyson Foods as the future is now 90% soyboy and 10% entomophagan (what in the Roth IRA fuck is that?)

GOOGL has long fired all their employees as the *They took our jerbs* protests intensified when unemployment reached 90% by AI takeover.

The omega variant of the corona virus only affects AI and Mexicans from the Tijuana region. MRNA, who is a mega corporation now, promised a new booster shots for all you zoomer fucks being kept alive by machines. No one cares if you fought in world war 3.

AMZN still trades at $3,300 while competitors are trading at 2000% the value since 2021 because they refused to stock split.  Jeff Bezos, who now lives in New Seattle on Mars, was reached for comment. He simply said: fuck you poors, get the fuck off my property.

WHY ARE MANY MUCHO JOB BAD FOR MI STOCKS?  Well a very good job report means the economy is doing better AND IT WILL ADD PRESSURE TO THE FED & J-POW TO START TAPERING AND/OR START TO LOOK AT RAISING RATES. 

LOW RATES GOOD FOR MARKET; Price of $ is cheap and its ok to have a crazy ass valuation.

You cant capture it in phone camera but its actually one of those things where you cant even believe your own eyes. Whatever it was, as it was passing, I saw one muuuch further behind with more faint of a light and traveling in the opposite direction. I lost focus of the first one and it disappeared into the abyss.

OR, hear me out, I can take the advice of the old and wise sage Buffet sensei. Patience. All it takes is patience. I was down 90% in my AMC position - had patience and sold for a 10K profit, which I then put all into WISH. Im only down 50% in WISH - long term, WISH is a great play. Why? Because one, I dont have any other choice, I dont sell for a loss. And two, because management (although lost at times) is seeking great excecs from big tech companies that can help reform this company. Three, Im an autist.",20,2021-08-13 07:58:02
