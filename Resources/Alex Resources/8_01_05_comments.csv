Main requirement to join the S&P 500:

>last reported quarter must be profitable 

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters 

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy, when retail collapsed during COVID they booted Macy's out very quickly.

Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in the current climate.

WHY ARE MANY MUCHO JOB BAD FOR MI STOCKS?  Well a very good job report means the economy is doing better AND IT WILL ADD PRESSURE TO THE FED & J-POW TO START TAPERING AND/OR START TO LOOK AT RAISING RATES. 

LOW RATES GOOD FOR MARKET; Price of $ is cheap and its ok to have a crazy ass valuation.
