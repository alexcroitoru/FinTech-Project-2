      "IV crush usually destroys half of new to options wsb'ers, followed by theta decay.  Play run up to earnings, but don't hold through.  Don't buy options that expire in a few days unless you except it's gambling not investing.  Risk goes up tremendously when you hold overnight, 10 fold risk holding over a weekend.  Options has been part of my trading for 7 years, 90% of the time I'm in and out within hours at most, 10-15k is the most I'll buy in lots at one time, but I do double down when I'm confident in direction.\n",
      "Buying anything right at open or close comes with more risk and reward.  Decent, repeated modest 4-10% gains can be had buying in during lunchtime dip and selling shortly thereafter, but nothing is guarantee.  Follow a stock for awhile don't just dive in, some I've followed for years but only play maybe 8-10 weeks out of the year but with a high success rate.  Get to know at least the price's past few weeks of floor and ceiling and what influences it.  I like to find stocks that have been beaten up over earnings and have recent insider buys.  What the insider paid is a good indicator of current floor price.  Don't feel it necessary to claim tribalism to being in the bull or bear gang.  This past year I was more calls than puts for obvious reasons but i was still about 70/30 calls/puts.  Once you win more than lose with directional option plays you can branch out.
