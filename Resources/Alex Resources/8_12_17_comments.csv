5,elonhole,"Every once in a while, you see a comment in this thread saying something along the lines 'just playing SPY is everything you need'. 

That's a guy realizing that his trading skills could not beat SPY and just going long in calls, shares or 3x is better than whatever the fuck he was doing before with meme stocks.

Hope you WISH bagholders learned this. The faster you accept the SPY in your heart, the better your port will be",42,2021-08-13 06:25:01

Clearly, I bought at the top, or rather, in a mountain  range, I bought at one of those mountain tops (13.10), I can sell for a 6K loss. OR, hear me out, I can take the advice of the old and wise sage Buffet sensei. Patience. All it takes is patience. I was down 90% in my AMC position - had patience and sold for a 10K profit, which I then put all into WISH. Im only down 50% in WISH - long term, WISH is a great play. Why? Because one, I dont have any other choice, I dont sell for a loss. And two, because management (although lost at times) is seeking great excecs from big tech companies that can help reform this company. Three, Im an autist.",18,2021-08-13 07:58:02

That's a guy realizing that his trading skills could not beat SPY and just going long in calls, shares or 3x is better than whatever the fuck he was doing before with meme stocks.

Hope you WISH bagholders learned this. The faster you accept the SPY in your heart, the better your port will be",42,2021-08-13 06:25:01

OR, hear me out, I can take the advice of the old and wise sage Buffet sensei. Patience. All it takes is patience. I was down 90% in my AMC position - had patience and sold for a 10K profit, which I then put all into WISH. Im only down 50% in WISH - long term, WISH is a great play. Why? Because one, I dont have any other choice, I dont sell for a loss.
