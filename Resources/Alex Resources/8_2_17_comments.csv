Main requirement to join the S&P 500:

>last reported quarter must be profitable 

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters 

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy, when retail collapsed during COVID they booted Macy's out very quickly.

Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in the current climate.

WHY ARE MANY MUCHO JOB BAD FOR MI STOCKS?  Well a very good job report means the economy is doing better AND IT WILL ADD PRESSURE TO THE FED & J-POW TO START TAPERING AND/OR START TO LOOK AT RAISING RATES. 

LOW RATES GOOD FOR MARKET; Price of $ is cheap and its ok to have a crazy ass valuation.

JOB REPORT OVERALL ECONOMY: VERY MUCHO GOOD FOR THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY & STABILITY. 

JOB REPORT FOR THE MARKET; VERY MUCHO BAD FOR EXPENSIVE HIGH MULTIPLE STOCKS (anything trading over 20X Sales WATCH THE FK OUT). 

WHY ARE MANY MUCHO JOB BAD FOR MI STOCKS?  Well a very good job report means the economy is doing better AND IT WILL ADD PRESSURE TO THE FED & J-POW TO START TAPERING AND/OR START TO LOOK AT RAISING RATES. 

LOW RATES GOOD FOR MARKET; Price of $ is cheap and its ok to have a crazy ass valuation. 

HIGHER RATES = VENOM TO GROWTH STOCKS.  Price of $ rises.  But just go back to the SPY or QQQ performance in Feb or May similar to that but worst.

Stock exchanges stay open 24/7 and 365 days by Cloud AI. Christmas became a trading day when Cyborg Elon proclaimed Santa Claus as a fraud when he took TSLA private for the 3rd time now despite protest from the SEC.

BYND meat absorbed Tyson Foods as the future is now 90% soyboy and 10% entomophagan (what in the Roth IRA fuck is that?)

GOOGL has long fired all their employees as the *They took our jerbs* protests intensified when unemployment reached 90% by AI takeover.

The omega variant of the corona virus only affects AI and Mexicans from the Tijuana region. MRNA, who is a mega corporation now, promised a new booster shots for all you zoomer fucks being kept alive by machines. No one cares if you fought in world war 3.

AMZN still trades at $3,300 while competitors are trading at 2000% the value since 2021 because they refused to stock split.  Jeff Bezos, who now lives in New Seattle on Mars, was reached for comment. He simply said: fuck you poors, get the fuck off my property.

It was an energy of light, looked like a star, traveling well above any plane would and no blinking lights, no red or green lights. It was moving so smoothly in a straight trajectory, fast, yet not as fast as the shooting stars I had also been seeing. You cant capture it in phone camera but its actually one of those things where you cant even believe your own eyes. Whatever it was, as it was passing, I saw one muuuch further behind with more faint of a light and traveling in the opposite direction. I lost focus of the first one and it disappeared into the abyss.

Now the staff greets me with ""hey it's 3-for-free!"" and ALWAYS give me three packets. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local McDonald's restaurant, I go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream, 1-2 times for breakfast on the weekend, and maybe once for dinner when I'm in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable, fast, and can match my daily nutritional needs.

Now the staff greets me with ""hey it's 3-for-free!"" and ALWAYS give me three packets. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local McDonald's restaurant, I go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream, 1-2 times for breakfast on the weekend, and maybe once for dinner when I'm in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable, fast, and can match my daily nutritional needs.

One time I asked for McChicken sauce packets and they gave me three. I said, ""Wow, three for free!"" and the nice friendly McDonald's worker laughed and said, ""I'm going to call you 3-for-free!"".

Now the staff greets me with ""hey it's 3-for-free!"" and ALWAYS give me three packets. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local McDonald's restaurant, I go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream, 1-2 times for breakfast on the weekend, and maybe once for dinner when I'm in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable, fast, and can match my daily nutritional needs.
